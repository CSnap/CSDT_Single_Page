Notice that if you click on 'Four Directions' you will see an additional four cultural groups to choose from. Go to the cultural tradition that your teacher assigns, and start your investigation! </p> <p>For example, if you were assigned the Anishinaabe quilting tradition, you will notice they are arranged in circular patterns. We call these groups of patterns <strong>heritage algorithms</strong> because it shows how computing ideas were independently invented in each culture. The Anishinaabe heritage algorithm is circular because of something called the medicine wheel. But what that really means, and why it is so important, you will need to discover.</p>",

For instance, in the example the costume, bud1, moves from (x=0,y=0) to (x=70, y=0), while the costume, petal2, moves from (x=70, y=0) to (x=140, y=0).
